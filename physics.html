<h1>Physics</h1>
<div class="intro"><p>I absolutely love physics, especially astrophysics and cosmology.  I was turned on to physics by my 11th grade physics teacher, then I went out and bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Multiverse-Parallel-Dimensions-Frontiers/dp/0470613521">In Search Of The Multiverse<a>, by John Gribbin, and I was hooked.  Although I don't want a career in academia, I think that my love of physics will somehow play into the rest of my life.</p>
	<p>I think what draws me to physics is the incompleteness of it.  No one knows why everything happens, and theories are being created and tested every day.  I usually stay up to date reading select articles in <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/">Scientific American<a>.</div>
